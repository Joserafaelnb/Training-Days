# Random Event Trainer

A small JavaScript program that picks a random sport event for an athlete and shows how many days they need to train.

## How it works

- Picks one random event: **Marathon**, **Triathlon**, or **Pentathlon**.
- Each event needs a different training time:
  - Marathon: 50 days
  - Triathlon: 100 days
  - Pentathlon: 200 days
- Prints the athlete’s name, event, and training days to the console.

## Example output

```
Nala's event is: Triathlon
Nala's time to train is: 100 days
Warren's event is: Marathon
Warren's time to train is: 50 days
```

> The events are random—output changes every time you run it.

## How to run

1. Save the code as `main.js`
2. Run in your terminal:
   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```
